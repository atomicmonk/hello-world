# hello-world

Greetings nomad,

You've found my secret hiding place. When I'm not drinking bullet-proof coffee or plunging into an ice bath to gain insight into the parasympathetic nervous system vs the syspathetic nervous system, I may be here in the wired hacking away on a project. Perhaps we'll meet at some point. Until then here's some food for thought...

The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) controls homeostasis and the body at rest and is responsible for the body's "rest and digest" function. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) controls the body's responses to a perceived threat and is responsible for the "fight or flight" response.

The PNS and SNS are part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is responsible for the involuntary functions of the human body.

Peace.
